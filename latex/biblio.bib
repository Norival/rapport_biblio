  abstract = {{A 2-yr experiment repeated at five locations across the northeastern
    United States evaluated the effect of weed density and time of
      glyphosate application on weed control and corn grain yield using a
      single postemergence (POST) application. Three weed densities, designed
      to reduce corn yields by 10, 25, and 50\%, were established across the
      locations, using forage sorghum as a surrogate weed. At each weed
      density, a single application of glyphosate at 1.12 kg ai/ha was applied
      to glyphosate-resistant corn at the V2, V4, V6, and V8 growth stages. At
      low and medium weed densities, the V4 through V8 applications provided
      nearly complete weed control and yields equivalent to the weed-free
      treatment. Weed biomass and the potential for weed seed production from
      subsequent weed emergence made the V2 timing less effective. At high
      weed densities, the V4 followed by the V6 timing provided the most
      effective weed control, while maintaining corn yield. Weed competition
      from subsequent weed emergence in the V2 application and the duration of
      weed competition in the V8 timing reduced yield on average by 12 and
      15\%, respectively. This research shows that single POST applications
      can be successful but weed density and herbicide timing are key
      elements.}},
