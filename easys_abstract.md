A review on on the relation between weeds, crop yield and herbicide use
=======================================================================

Based on the assumption that weeds negatively impact crop yield, aggressive
management practices have been conducted since the 1950's.
However, this assumption is now partially rejected by the scientific community,
leading to new questions.
To assess this question, we conducted a review on by searching the WebOfScienc
online database
This request showed a total of 54 articles on the relations between crop yield,
weeds and herbicide use, ranging from 1991 to 2016.
What appears most relevant is a huge lack of standardization amongst these
papers which did not allowed for a proper quantitative analysis.
A simple descriptive analysis showed that weeds seem to have a negative impact
on crop yield alone.
Other metrics like yield components or grains quality are not reported often.
The dominant crop species is corn, with 13 studies (5 being herbicide-resistant
GMO crops).
Other crops are wheat and oilseed rape.
On the 22 articles reviewed so far, 2 were conducted in a glasshouse, 18 at
experimental farms and only 2 at actual farms.
Only half of studies mention quantitative results regarding crop yield and only
2 mention effect size index.
Although economic factors seem to be an important variable to support policy
making, only to articles were including such factors.
Very few studies conduct a general survey on weeds and rather report the effects
on dominant weeds, with an average of 5 species.
The most used metrics are weed density and weed aboveground biomass.
Once again, few studies mention quantitative results.
