Widely accepted negative effect of weeds on crop yield may lack the scientific background to support the use of herbicides
==========================================================================================================================

Based on the assumption that weeds negatively impact crop yield, aggressive
management practices have been conducted since the 1950's through herbicide use,
leading to air, water and soil pollution.
Growers around the world are now facing a trade-off between crop productivity
and environmental preservation.
That is why the efficacy of herbicides for crop protection need to be assessed.
We then wanted to analyse how this question had been tackled in the scientific
community and how their results could be compared.
A query to Web of Science surprisingly showed a mere number of 54 articles
addressing this matter.
We reported data about the crops, the weeds, the sampling methods and teh
variety of metrics used for weeds or crops.
First, what appears most relevant is a huge lack of standardization among these
papers, which did not allow for a proper quantitative summary of the results.

From the 54 articles first selected, only 40 could be reviewed.
16 studies were conducted in North America, 12 in Europe, 10 in Asia and 2 in
South America.
The dominant crop is wheat, with 20 studies, then corn (18 studies) and oilseed
rape (2 studies).
5 % are greenhouses experiment and, among the field experiments, only 12 % are
from actual farms.
70 % of studies test the effect of a single herbicide, 18 % are using 2
herbicides and 12 % are using 3 or more herbicides.
Only 16 % of studies are testing multiple doses of herbicides.
49 % of studies do not mention the weed richness, 13 % consider a single
species and 10 % consider more than 10 species.
66 % studied naturally occuring weeds whereas 24 % sowed surrogate weeds at
desired densities.
48 different metrics are used to quantify the impact of weeds, grain yield
(biomass/ha) being the most widely used (28 %).
Very few studies consider grain quality.

55 % of studies reported a negative impact of weeds on grain yield, with a mean
decrease of 54 %.


<!-- These two were the only studies including economic analysis, which should be an
important variable to support policy making.

The dominant crop species is corn, with 13 studies (5 being herbicide-resistant
GMO).

While a simple descriptive analysis showed that weeds seem to have a negative
impact on crop yield alone, other metrics like yield components or grains
quality are not reported often.

Very few studies conducted a general survey on weeds and rather reported the
effects reagarding dominant weeds, with an average of 5 species per study.

These preliminary results show that a study using a strong methodology and
including factors such as economic income is needed to conclude on that matter.
