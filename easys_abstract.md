A lack of standardization among studies may temper the negative effects of weeds-crop competition
=================================================================================================


Based on the assumption that weeds negatively impact crop yield, aggressive
management practices have been conducted since the 1950's through herbicide use,
leading to air, water and soil pollution.
Growers are now facing a trade-off between crop productivity and environmental
preservation, making it of paramount importance to assess the benefical effects
of herbicides.

We then wanted to analyse how this question had been tackled in the scientific
community and how their results could be compared.
A query to Web of Science surprisingly showed a mere number of 54 articles
addressing this matter.
We reported data about the crops, the weeds, the sampling methods and the
variety of metrics used on weeds and crops.
First, what appears most relevant is a huge lack of standardization among these
papers, which did not allow for a proper quantitative summary of the results.

From the 54 articles first selected, only 40 could be reviewed, including 16
studies conducted in North America, 12 in Europe, 10 in Asia and 2 in South
America.
The dominant crop is wheat, with 20 studies, then corn (18 studies) and oilseed
rape (2 studies).
5 % are greenhouses experiment and, among the field experiments, only 12 % are
from actual farms.
70 % of studies assess the effect of a single herbicide, 18 % are using 2
herbicides and 12 % are using 3 or more herbicides.
Only 16 % of studies are testing multiple doses of herbicides.
49 % of studies do not mention the weed richness, 13 % consider a single
species and 10 % consider more than 10 species.
66 % studied naturally occuring weeds whereas 24 % sowed surrogate weeds at
desired densities.
48 different metrics are used to quantify the impact of weeds, grain yield
(biomass/ha) being the most widely used (28 %).
Very few studies consider grain quality and even less included an economic
analysis, which should be an important variable to support policy making.

55 % of studies reported a negative impact of weeds on grain yield, with a mean
decrease of 54 %.
The decrease among fields are not different than that among greenhouses
experiments.
One of the two studies reporting economic analysis mentioned an increase of net
benefits, but only in conjunction to reduced tillage.

These preliminary results show that a study using a strong methodology and
including factors such as economic income is needed to conclude on that matter.
