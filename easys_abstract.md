Widely accepted negative effect of weeds on crop yield may lack the scientific background to support the use of herbicides
==========================================================================================================================

Based on the assumption that weeds negatively impact crop yield, aggressive
management practices have been conducted since the 1950's through herbicide use,
leading to air, water and soil pollution.
The increasing need for new practices has then led to new research.
We wanted to analyse how this question had been tackled in the scientific
community and how their results could be compared.
This request showed a total of 54 articles on the relations between crop yield,
weeds and herbicide use, ranging from 1991 to 2016.
We reported the crop species, the weed species, how these have been sampled, the
metrics used and their diversity.
First, what appears most relevant is a huge lack of standardization amongst
these papers, which did not allow for a proper quantitative summary of the
results.
On the 22 articles reviewed so far, only 2 were conducted at actual farms, the
others being conducted at experimental farms or in glasshouses.
These two were the only studies including economic analysis, which should be an
important variable to support policy making.
The dominant crop species is corn, with 13 studies (5 being herbicide-resistant
GMO).
While a simple descriptive analysis showed that weeds seem to have a negative
impact on crop yield alone, other metrics like yield components or grains
quality are not reported often.
Very few studies conducted a general survey on weeds and rather reported the
effects reagarding dominant weeds, with an average of 5 species per study.
These preliminary results show that a study using a strong methodology and
including factors such as economic income is needed to conclude on that matter.
