A review on on the relation between weeds, crop yield and herbicide use
=======================================================================

Based on the assumption that weeds negatively impact crop yield, aggressive
management practices have been conducted since the 1950's.
However, this assumption is now partially rejected by the scientific community,
leading to new questions.
To assess this question, we conducted a review on this matter.
A online request to the WebOfScience database showed a total of 54 articles on
the relations between crop yield, weeds and herbicide use, ranging from 1991 to
2016.
A huge lack of standardization amongst these papers did not allowed for a proper
quantitative analysis.
A descriptive analysis showed taht weeds seem to have a negative impact on crop
yield alone.
Yield components and grains quality are not reported often.
However, very few articles investigated this relation more in-depth.
On the 22 articles reveiwed so far, 2 were conducted in a glasshouse, 18 at
experimental farms and only 2 at actual farms.
The dominant crop species is corn, with 13 studies (5 being herbicide-resistant
GMO crops).
Other crops are wheat and oilseed rape.
Only half of studies mention quantitative results regarding crop yield and only
2 mention effect size index.
Although economic factors seem to be an important variable to support policy
making, only to articles were including such factors.
Very few studies make a general survey on weeds and rather report the effects on
dominant weeds, with an average of 5 species.
The most used metrics are weed density and weed aboveground biomass.
