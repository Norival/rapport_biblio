Widely accepted negative effect of weeds on crop yield may lack the scientific background to support the use of herbicides
==========================================================================================================================

Based on the assumption that weeds negatively impact crop yield, aggressive
management practices have been conducted since the 1950's.
However, this assumption is now partially rejected by the scientific community,
leading to new research.
To assess this question, we conducted a review by searching the WebOfScience
online database.
This request showed a total of 54 articles on the relations between crop yield,
weeds and herbicide use, ranging from 1991 to 2016.
What appears most relevant is a huge lack of standardization amongst these
papers.
This did not allow for a proper quantitative analysis of the results.
On the 22 articles reviewed so far, 2 were conducted in a glasshouse, 18 at
experimental farms and only 2 at actual farms.
A simple descriptive analysis showed that weeds seem to have a negative impact
on crop yield alone.
However, other metrics like yield components or grains quality are not reported
often.
The dominant crop species is corn, studied in 13 studies (5 of which are
herbicide-resistant GMO crops).
Other major crops are wheat and oilseed rape.
Only half of studies mention quantitative results regarding crop yield and only
2 mention effect size indices.
Although economic factors seem to be an important variable to support policy
making, only two articles were including such factors.
Very few studies conducted a general survey on weeds and rather reported the
effects reagarding dominant weeds, with an average of 5 species per study.
The most used metrics are weed density and weed aboveground biomass.
Once again, few studies mention quantitative results.
